fiëé croisée
============

I like making crossword puzzles. But it needs *a lot* of time without the right tools. 

So this is some kind of dictionary to look for matching words. At the moment.

I hope it will become a tool that makes creating crossword puzzles just fun.


Installation
------------

It's a Django application, to be run on Apache/mod_wsgi.

The provided fabfile (fabric deployment) is for an Debian server 
and documented in this gist: http://gist.github.com/158177


Features
--------

* public
  * find words that match a specified pattern (e.g. PY?H?N or ?YT*)
  * work in a puzzle grid (custom size 4-20 lines/rows)
* admin
  * manage words and their descriptions in several dictionaries
  * import word lists


Make a wordlist
---------------

# use a dictionary from aspell:

 aspell dump master > mydict.txt

# get some long text, e.g. from Project Gutenberg
# write your own

* The wordlist file is expected in UTF-8 encoding.
* Format is "(word)\t(description)\t(priority)\n". Description and priority are optional (default to word and 0).
* run `make-wordlist.py` on it (or several), result is `wordlist.txt`


Make a dictionary
-----------------

* upload a wordlist file to your croisee installation (Wordlist Upload); that may take a while
* fix the descriptions and priorities, if you like


Roadmap
-------

I'm planning to implement the following features in about this order:

* search-in-grid (place cursor, find matching words in both directions)
* user registration (OpenID?)
* export grid and solution as text / HTML / TeX
* import text files
* safe puzzles for registered users as private/public
* make safed puzzles available
* export as PDF
* different types of crossword grids (fat lines instead of blocked cells, uneven outline...)
* automate filling the grid (algorithm?)
* set up a paid service
* get rich ;-)


Bugs / Todo
-----------

* Limit public results to 100
* Show only public dicts
* admin: if adding to an existing dict, disable other fields

Feel free to ask after different, additional licensing.

I don't plan to release my edited dictionaries, because in them's the most work.
